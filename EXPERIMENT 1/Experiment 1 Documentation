==================================

AIM:- Getting started with basic Linux Commands and directory structure, execute file, directory operations.

CREATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:_
---------------------------------
>> touch <filename>  --> Creates a file
>> mkdir <dirname>  --> Creates a directory

CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY:-
----------------------------

>> pwd --> Displays the current working directory

CHANGE DIRECTORY:-

>> cd ~<username> --> Changes the directory to the home sirectory of a different user

VIEWING CONTENTS OF TEXT FILES:-
--------------------------------

>> cat <filename> --> Displays the text scroll off the screen
>> cat <file1> <file2> --> Concatenates the contents of the two text files
>> more <filename> --> Displays the file one scornful at a time
>> less <filename> --> Similat but faster than the more command

LISTING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:-
--------------------------------

>> ls --> Lists the files in the current directory
>> ls -l --> Prevides a long listing of all the files
>> ls -l -h --> Same as the above command but the file sizes will be in human readable form
>> ls -F --> Marks all the executable with a * and all the directories with a /
>> ls --color --> Shows a coloured listing of all the files
>> ls -a --> Shows all the files in the present directory including the special dot files

COPYING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:-
-------------------------------

>> cp <file1> <file2> --> Copies file 1 to file 2
>> cp <file1> <dirname> --> Copies file1 to Directory <dirname>
>> cp -r <dirname1> <dirname2> --> Copies dirname1 directory to directory dirname2

RENAMING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:- 
---------------------------------

>>mv <oldname> <newname> --> Renames file with old name to new name
>> mv <olddir> <newdir> --> Renames directory with name olddir to newdir
>> mv <filename> <dirname> --> Moves files with name as filename to directory dirname

SOME USEFUL COMMANDS:-
----------------------

>> clear --> Clears the terminal screen
>> locate <filename> --> Searches for a specified filename
>> passwd --> Prompt to change the password of the current user
>> whoami --> Displays the details of the current logged in user

GETTING HELP:-
--------------

>> man <commandname> --> Finds out what a command does
>> man -f <commandname> --> One line summary of what the command does
>> man -k <keyword> --> Searches for a command with a particular keyword

IMPORTANT FILES IN LINUX:-
---------------------------

--> /bin # Essential user command and binary files
--> /boot # Static files of the boot loader
--> /dev # Device files
--> /etc # Host specific system configuration
--> /home # User home directories
--> /lib # Essential shared libraries and kernal modules
--> /mnt # Mount point for devices
--> /opt # Add on application software packages
--> /sbin # System binary files
--> /tmp # Temporary files
--> /usr # User utilities and applications
--> /var # Variable files
--> /root # Home directory of the user

EXECUTING FILES:-
-----------------
File execution in Linux :-
--> cd to the directory which contains the file to be executed
--> Type "chmod +x <name of the file>" which provides system permissions for the file to be executed
--> Type "sh./<name of the file>" to execute the file
